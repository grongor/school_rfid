Daemon must run as root - it must have privilege to add/remove users to/from
certain groups. When client connects to the daemon then it is able to send commands.

Available commands are:
	authenticate *username*
		If *username* is found then it waits for RFID card to be
		read. If there is card assigned to given *username* user
		is added to the appropriate group(s).
		
		Return messages:
			USER_NOT_FOUND	User doesn't belong to any group
			INSERT_CARD	Daemon is waiting for the card
					to be read
			READ_TIMEOUT	Operation was aborted because
					of card read timeout
			INVALID_CARD	Card doesn't match the given user
			OK *sessionKey* *group*{,..}
					User was succesfully authenticated		
 
	logout {*sessionKey*|*username* *mainPassword*}
		User is logged out from his session identified by
		*sessionKey*. If there are 2 parameters passed then all
		*username* sessions are logged out. *mainPassword* is
		required in that case.

		Return messages:
			INVALID_PWD	Given main password is invalid
